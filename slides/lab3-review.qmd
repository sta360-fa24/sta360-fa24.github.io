# Exponential distribution

## Exercise

Physicists studying a radioactive substance measure the times at which the substance emits a particle. They will record $n+1$ emissions and set $Y_1$ to be the time elapsed between the first and second emission, $Y_2$ to be the time elapsed between the second and third emission and so on. They will model the data as $Y_1, \ldots Y_n | \theta \sim \text{exponential}(\theta)$. The pdf of the exponential($\theta$) distribution is 

$$
p(y |\theta) = \theta e^{-\theta y} \ \text{ for } \ y>0, \ \theta>0.
$$

For this distribution, $E[Y|\theta] = \frac{1}{\theta}$.

(a). Write out the corresponding joint density $p(y_1, \ldots, y_n | \theta)$ and simplify as much as possible. Justify each step of your calculation.

(b). Compute the maximum likelihood estimate $\hat{\theta}_{MLE}$, i.e. the value $\hat{\theta}_{MLE}$ that maximizes $p(y_1,\ldots y_n | \theta)$. Hint: it's easier to work with the log-likelihood.

(c). Choose a prior $p(\theta)$ that is conjugate to the likelihood. Hint: look at kernels of densities on the distribution sheet. Write out the formula for $p(\theta | y_1, \ldots y_n)$, up to a proportionality in $\theta$, and simplify as much as possible. From this, identify explicitly the posterior distribution of $\theta$ (i.e., write "the posterior is a blank distribution with parameter(s) blank)".

(d). Obtain the formula for $E[\theta, y_1, \ldots y_n]$ as a function of $a, b, n$ and $y_1, \ldots y_n$, and try to write this as a function of the estimator $\hat{\theta}$ you found in part (b). What does $E[\theta | y_1,\ldots,y_n]$ get close to as $n$ increases?

(e). Report a 95\% posterior confidence interval for $\theta$.
