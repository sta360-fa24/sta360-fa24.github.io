To receive credit for this assignment, write at the top of your paper your name and Duke netID. For example, my netID is `aaf29`.

### Exercise 1

Write "posterior" or "prior" in the blank below:

$\int p(\tilde{y}|\theta) p(\theta | y_1,\ldots y_n)d\theta$ is a ___ predictive distribution.

### Exercise 2

Expand $p(\theta | y)$ using Bayes' rule (include the normalization constant).

### Exercise 3

`TRUE` or `FALSE`

Monte Carlo integration error scales $\mathcal{O}(\frac{1}{\sqrt{N}})$ where $N$ is the number of independent samples from the posterior.
