To receive credit for this assignment, write at the top of your paper your name and Duke netID. For example, my netID is `aaf29`.

### Exercise 1

`TRUE` or `FALSE`: The Metropolis-Hastings algorithm is a generalization of both the Metropolis algorithm and the Gibbs sampler.

### Exercise 2

`TRUE` or `FALSE`: the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm requires symmetric proposal $J(\theta^* | \theta^{(s)})$.

### Exercise 3

`TRUE` or `FALSE`: for any valid proposal distribution J, $J(\theta^* | \theta^{(1)}, \ldots, \theta^{(s)}) = J(\theta^* | \theta^{(s)})$.
