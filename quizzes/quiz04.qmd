### Exercise 1

$$
Y | \theta, \sigma^2 \sim N(\theta, \sigma^2) 
$$

What is a conjugate class of priors for $\theta | \sigma^2$?


### Exercise 2

`TRUE` or `FALSE`

An estimator is a random variable.

### Exercise 3

Let $\theta_0$ be the true value of $\theta$.

If $E[\hat{\theta}| \theta = \theta_0] = \theta_0$, we say $\hat{\theta}$ is a ____ estimator of $\theta$.
