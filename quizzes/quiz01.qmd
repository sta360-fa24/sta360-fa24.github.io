To receive credit for this assignment, write at the top of your paper your name and Duke netID. For example, my netID is `aaf29`.

### Exercise 1

`TRUE` or `FALSE`: The beta prior is conjugate to a binomial likelihood.

### Exercise 2

`TRUE` or `FALSE`: $p(y|\theta)$ is the marginal likelihood.

### Exercise 3

In Bayes' theorem (written below), which term is the "normalizing constant"?

$$
p(\theta | y) = \frac{p(y |\theta) p(\theta)}{\int p(y, \theta) d\theta}
$$


### Exercise 4

$$
\begin{aligned}
X &\sim gamma(k, \theta)\\
p(x) &= \frac{1}{\Gamma(k) \theta^k}x^{k-1}e^{-x/\theta}
\end{aligned}
$$
The kernel of the distribution is ___.
