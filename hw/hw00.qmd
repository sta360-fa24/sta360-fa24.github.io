## Exercise 1

Simplify 

$$
\log(e^{a_1} e^{a_2} e^{a_3} \cdots e^{a_n})
$$

## Exercise 2

Find the derivative.

$$
\frac{d}{dx} \left( \frac{x}{\log x} \right)
$$
## Exercise 3

What is the ordinary least squares estimator of $\beta$ (1-dimensional) in the linear regression $y = x \beta + \epsilon$ with iid errors?

## Exercise 4

What is the ordinary least squares estimator of $\beta$ (p-dimensional) in the linear regression $y = X \beta + \epsilon$ with iid errors?

## Exercise 5

In linear regression with p-dimensional Î², what is the interpretation of the estimate for the jth coefficient?

## Exercise 6

Compute the integral,

$$
\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} e^{-x^2} dx
$$

## Exercise 7

$X \sim N(\mu, \sigma^2)$ reads "X is normally distributed with **mean** $\mu$ and **variance** $\sigma^2$.

Let

$$
\begin{aligned}
X &\sim N(0, 1),\\
Y &\sim N(3, 2),\\
Z &= X + Y
\end{aligned}
$$
What is the distribution of $Z$? What is $\mathbb{E}[Z]$ and $Var(Z)$?

## Exercise 8

In your own words, the "support" of random variable is...

## Exercise 9

TRUE/FALSE: The product of two uniform[0, 1] random variables is uniform[0, 1].
