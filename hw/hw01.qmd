## Exercise 1

Let $X_i \in \mathcal{X}$ for all $i \in \{1, 2, \ldots\}$ and suppose our belief model for $\mathbf{X} = \{ X_1, \ldots X_n \}$ is exchangeable for all $n$. Show, using de Finetti's theorem, that for all $i \neq j$,

$$
Cov(X_i, X_j) \geq 0 \text{ and }
$$

$$
Corr(X_i, X_j) \geq 0.
$$
