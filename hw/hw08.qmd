## Exercise 1 


6.3 from Hoff. You can simulate from a constrained normal distribution with mean `mean` and standard deviation `sd`, constrained to lie in the interval $(a,b)$ using the following function:

```{r}
rcnorm<-function(n, mean=0, sd=1, a=-Inf, b=Inf){
  u = runif(n, pnorm((a - mean) / sd), pnorm((b - mean) / sd))
  mean + (sd * qnorm(u))
}
```

Note that you can use this function to simulate a vector of constrained normal random variables, each with a potentially different mean, standard deviation, and constraints.

To load the data for this exercise, run the code below

```{r}
#| eval: false
divorce = readr::read_csv("https://sta360-fa24.github.io/data/divorce.csv")
```
